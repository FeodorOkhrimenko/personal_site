# My very first personal site
## This project's main goal is to demonstrate my html, css, and javascript skills; as well as, getting to know me better. 
The website consist of three pages: a home page to get to know me, a about page to depict my interest outside the scope
of tech, and my portfolio page that showcases my projects. At this point in time I have no projects to show, but as time 
goes by and I learn more about fullstack I hope to impress you with my portfolio.
